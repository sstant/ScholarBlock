**Account Types**

**Funding Scholarships**

We are holding the ETH so that any applicants know that the funds are currently available.

**Permissions**

There are several functions that only the owner of a scholarship can access. This is the first step towards protecting user information, starting with their interest in scholarships. This will become even more important once essay prompts are added to the application process.

**Roadmap**

KYC will obviously be a huge part of this project. Specifically, we will want to verify students.
